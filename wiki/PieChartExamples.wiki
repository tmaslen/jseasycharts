== Basic pie chart ==

You can use the API with very minimal settings. You can create a chart with just a reference to a parent element and an array of values, like so:

{{{
jsEasyCharts.pie(
        'chart1',
        [10,10,10]
);
}}}

== Setting data with JSON ==

As well as defining the data for the chart as an array, you can also pass in a JSON object. If you do this, the labels in the JSON object will be used in the chart. A third optional param in the method call is an options object. Here you can set the size of the chart.

{{{
jsEasyCharts.pie(
        'chart2',
        {
                Apricots: 10,
                Walnuts: 20,
                Hazelnut: 30,
                Almond: 40
        },
        {
                size: '500x250'
        }
);
}}}

== Setting data with a HTML table, changing the type of bar chart, and changing the colour ==

Not only can you use an array and a JSON object to define the data for the chart, you can also pass in a (2 row/column only) table. The options object also lets you set the type of pie chart, and pass in a list of colours to use for the values.
